Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Estimation at the Arctic using SARAL/AltiKa brightness temperature dual-frequency (23.8 GHz and 37 GHz) data at a grid resolution of 25 km. The Algorithm accurately generates SIC as can be seen below. This is a projrct funded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
